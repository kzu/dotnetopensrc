Additional thoughts:
1 - What should be done with SimpleTypes? Validation? Serialization? CLR/XSD Convertion?
2 - Add the posibility to specify wildcards in ApplyTo/ExceptOf filters?

Limitations:
1 - From source XSD, in the ApplyTo/ExceptOf sections, only UnhandledAttributes cause effect (see MSDN help)
2 - The Add method with a parameter for each field of the dataset isn't generated. We added one which
	receives an object array of parameters, or a variable length parameters for each field.
3 - Look for support for external schemas.


Design decisions:
1 - ApplyTo and ExceptOf sections take element names without TypeNaming or CollectionNaming conventions. 
	That is, they match the element in the source schema as is.
2 - Configurations are accumulative if more than one file is selected for the same schema.
3 - Traverses are managed by the Traverser class.
4 - If a complex element has the msdata:IsDataSet=true attribute, the TypeNaming convention won't be applied.
5 - All UnhandledAttributes are appended to the type members while they are being added to the CodeDom graph.
	The key used to add them is the LocalName. (View potencial namespace conflicts.)
6 - Commented code lines above a complex CodeDom statement represents the result of it in C# source code.
7 - IsNested property of a Relation defined in the XSD designer is ignored. It is only set for the relation when
	the element is contained inside another one.
8 - The GetXXX property to retrieve child rows is only added if the relation is defined and it doesn't have
	the ConstraintOnly attribute set to "true". This is the MS generator default behavior.
9 - Every <Runner><Customizations><Customization> row without a runOrder attribute is assigned the "0" runOrder.
	All the rows with the same runOrder are executed simultaneously. To execute one row last, assign the -1
	value to the runOrder attribute.
	
TODO Features:
1 - Add traverser element as optional child of <source>, as an specific file may need an special traverser.
2 - Review the namespace handling for customization files. I think there's plenty of room for improvements there.
