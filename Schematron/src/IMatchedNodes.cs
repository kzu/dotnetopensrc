	/// As different <see cref="XPathNavigator"/> can exist, and even be developed

	/// implementation optimized for specific stores. 
	/// <para>
	/// Each navigator implementation typically provides an interface to let 
	/// applications get access to the underlying store, such as the <see cref="IHasXmlNode"/> 
	/// or <see cref="IXmlLineInfo"/> interfaces, implemented in navigators create by 
	/// <see cref="XmlDocument"/> or <see cref="XPathDocument"/> classes.
