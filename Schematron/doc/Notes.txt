1 - Multithreading left for the future. Not sure how to WaitAll for the threads in the pool to finish before returning. Adds complexity. Benchmark performance gains!

2 - Abstract rules with an ID can be anywhere in the schematron schema, and it will work anyway, according to the XSLT implementations. We do so too, for compatibility.

3 - <key> elements under <rule> are currently ignored. An additional expression could be created to offer support for it. Check. UPDATE: no need for this element as WXS have good support for keys/unique/keyref

4 - Make NDoc stylesheet to show <seealso>, <author>, <authorref>, <link> and <linkref> elements.

5 - MUST DO: create the XmlFormatter, define a schema and format for the output. This is VERY important for WebService scenarios!!

6 - SHOULD DO: create the HtmlFormatter, for user friendly use!!


---- OLD NOTES ----
1 - SchematronSchema.Read() will use standard XmlSchema validation to check for a valid schematron definition.
2 - It is a Composite implementation.
3 - Should it use Visitor design pattern for evaluation? May ease the process of processing the tree for other uses, such as diagnostics, conformance reports, etc.
